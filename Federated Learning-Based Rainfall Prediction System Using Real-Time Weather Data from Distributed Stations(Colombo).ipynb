        "\n",
        "Accurate rainfall prediction plays a vital role in numerous sectors including agriculture, water resource management, and disaster preparedness. Traditional centralized approaches to weather forecasting often rely on collecting all station data into a single location for model training. However, this approach poses challenges related to data privacy, bandwidth constraints, and real-time responsiveness—especially when weather stations are geographically distributed.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project introduces a Federated Learning-Based Rainfall Prediction System, which enables multiple weather stations to collaboratively train a shared machine learning model without transferring raw data. Instead, only model updates (e.g., weights or gradients) are shared with a central server. This decentralized approach preserves data locality and privacy while still harnessing the predictive power of distributed datasets.\n",

        "The Sri Lanka Weather Dataset is a comprehensive collection of weather data for 30 prominent cities in Sri Lanka, covering the period from January 1, 2010, to January 1, 2023. The dataset offers a wide range of meteorological parameters, enabling detailed analysis and insights into the climate patterns of different regions in Sri Lanka.\n",

        "The dataset includes information such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "Time: The timestamp of each weather observation.\n",
        "Weather Code: A numerical code representing the weather conditions at the given time.\n",
        "Temperature: Maximum, minimum, and mean values of 2-meter temperature.\n",
        "Apparent Temperature: Maximum, minimum, and mean values of apparent temperature, which takes into account factors like wind chill or heat index.\n",
        "Sunrise and Sunset: The times of sunrise and sunset for each day.\n",
        "Shortwave Radiation: Sum of shortwave radiation received during the observation period.\n",
        "Precipitation: Total sum of precipitation, including rainfall and snowfall.\n",
        "Precipitation Hours: The duration of time with measurable precipitation.\n",
        "Wind Speed and Gusts: Maximum values of wind speed and wind gusts at 10 meters above ground level.\n",
        "Wind Direction: Dominant wind direction at 10 meters above ground level.\n",
        "Evapotranspiration: Reference evapotranspiration (ET0) based on the FAO Penman-Monteith equation.\n",
        "Latitude, Longitude, and Elevation: Geographic coordinates and elevation of each city.\n",
        "Country and City: Names of the country and city corresponding to each weather observation.\n",
        "This dataset was sourced from Open-Meteo and simplemaps, and the data was collected using a basic Python script. The collected data was pre-processed to ensure cleanliness and readability before being stored in CSV format."

        "\n",
        "This project explored rainfall prediction using Support Vector Regression (SVR) models in a federated learning context, comparing the performance of local models, a federated model (using prediction averaging), and a centralized model. The dataset used contained weather data from three stations in Sri Lanka: Colombo, Mount Lavinia, and Kesbewa.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Findings:\n",
        "Data Preprocessing: The data for each station was successfully loaded, cleaned by imputing missing numeric values with the mean, and enhanced with 'month', 'precipitation_sum', and 'avg_rainfall_pct' features.\n",
        "Model Training: Individual SVR models were trained locally for each station. A centralized SVR model was trained on the combined data from all stations. A true federated averaging approach for SVR model weights was attempted but found infeasible due to the structural differences in SVR models (varying support vectors). Consequently, a federated approach based on averaging the predictions from local models was implemented.\n",
        "Performance Evaluation: The models were evaluated using a comprehensive set of metrics, including R², MSE, MAE, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score, with classification metrics derived by thresholding the regression output.\n",
        "The Centralized Model generally exhibited the best performance across most metrics, achieving the highest R² and F1 scores and the lowest MSE and MAE. This is expected as it has access to the complete dataset.\n",
        "The Federated Model (Prediction Averaging) performed better than the individual local models on average, demonstrating the benefit of combining information from different clients even without direct model weight aggregation.\n",
        "The Local Models showed varying performance depending on the station, reflecting the differences in local weather patterns.\n",
        "Rainfall Prediction: The trained local, federated, and centralized models were successfully used to predict average rainfall percentage on new data, demonstrating the applicability of each approach for inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "The results indicate that while a centralized model trained on pooled data achieves the best predictive performance, the federated learning approach (specifically, prediction averaging in this case) offers a viable alternative. The federated model's performance, while not surpassing the centralized model, is better than training individual models in isolation. This highlights the potential of federated learning to improve model performance by leveraging data from multiple distributed sources without compromising data privacy, as raw data remains on the local clients.\n",
        "\n",
        "The inability to perform true federated averaging of SVR model parameters due to the nature of SVR and its reliance on support vectors is a limitation of this implementation. However, the prediction averaging strategy provides a practical workaround."
